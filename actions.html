             Today’s world is composed of ecosystems, societies and various kind of institution. But, whatever they differ, there is a word that is common throughout the world. Actually, the age-old adage “ action speaks louder than word” has been a guiding principle for individuals throughout history. It emphasizes the importance of not just only expressing one’s intentions or goals, but also taking concrete actions to achieve them. This idea is relevant in today’s fast-paced world where we are constantly bombarded with sweet words and promises, and often end with a different one. Thus, the struggling strategies of hard working will speak loudly till end. Actually, life is not a bed of roses. Even it were right, there would be thorns of the rose. So, take a deep breath and let’s now look the benefits of action rather than words.</br>
             Technologies become so common among the people that they use them almost every day. But, have you ever thought they can create from just words? They were born of the hard actions of a unite of people who intent us to be more advanced than before. A thousand of words turned into a letter. They implemented the letters into reality with their hands. Since the turn of the millennium, thanks to a group of intentional ones, there have so many developments in people lifestyles. Frankly speaking, we turned into polite mankind from the ancient ones. Moreover, the sky buildings, the stunning big cities and the great flying objects comes from the actions of people, not from words. It is a good solution to sleep rather than losing direction in fascinating words. Actually, words are loving, fast and sweet, whereas actions are hard, tired and boring. But, the genuine one become the great holder of people as a saying goes, “ No pain, no gain”. The sweat and blood are used to achieve the great accomplishments. But, words are just a pulling force to the path of this. No one cannot judge one’s status with the impressive feeling. Also, proving something with hard actions is the most delicious one among the real life cuisines.  The daydreams of people do come true due to the energetic moods and realistic implementing. We were given the hands for not just pointing here and there. It is for doing and performing. Thus, like it or not, actions speaks louder than the words.
            </br> All things considered; the creation of the world started with actions. From Paleolithic Age to current age, numerous people have shown who they are with their action rather than saying the nascent words. As they are not stupid ones, they understood that actions speak louder than words. For me, following by this unique principle, I would like to do everything with precise intention with the hard actions- instead of yield for everything.
