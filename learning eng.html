Actually, I found no interest in English when I was young. What I mean is that it is not more than a subject in the curriculum. Since I was in Kindergarten, I had started my alphabet learning, not knowing what they were and how they were useful. But, I truly enjoyed this learning era. The memorable cacophonies in my primary academy mixed with some vocabularies like A for ‘Apple’. But, I was still showing no obvious appetite in English to assume as an important language in my future. I still remember that I was over the moon when I could memorize two or three sentences and tell my teacher I’d done. In the exam, I only remember that I had to take into account what the teachers gave me and forced to go over again and again. So, it was so rare in my village to acquire proper learning method of English Language. Not only many adults but also number of students liked to study by heart rather than approaching English as a language. In middle school, I stared standing out for my deep passion for English, despite struggling with grammar rules. In Grade 7, I encountered Daw Lay Lay Nwe, a teacher who charged a modest fee of 5,000 MMK per month to teach basic grammar. Under her patient guidance, my understanding of English blossomed, and I began expressing myself with newfound confidence and clarity. This journey ignited my lifelong passion for the language, demonstrating the transformative power of dedicated mentorship and a thirst for learning. But, in spite of my deep emotions emerged, I was still a weak learner with my lack of fluency for four main skills in English. In high school, I also met a person who could illuminate my covered obsession for English. Tr Daw Chit Hsu taught me more advanced gramma and made me practise to improve my reading skills. I could feel transformative development compared to me in middle school. It would be more efficient as I was not a pure greenhorn, thanks to my middle school teacher. But, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, I stopped my learning as it was really severe throughout the country and schools were forced to close. I was totally jack of all trades during this pandemic and had no thirst to continue my learning. I was really happy to spend time with my friends, creating unforgettable memories. But, my endeavor for this language was back with the reconnection of my teacher, Daw Chit Hsu. It was my first time of learning online and also the first time of interacting in English. My teacher told me that our journey of learning English in language form had started. At the commencement, I got into hot water in speaking and listening. But, I was gradually well-established with it. Also, my teacher made me write in my forms- sentences, paragraphs, and essays. Owing to a well-built teacher-student relationship, I found myself among obvious progresses and I was so pleased with my growth. We together spoke in English so as to improve my speaking. I tried my best to comprehend what teacher said for my boost of listening. One or two essays per week could absolutely make me think and write properly. In these ways, I learned to enhance my English on the wrong side of 1 year. When I was G-12, I lacked my successive learning since I had to focus on my school lessons. But, now, after my matriculation exam, I restarted my language learning again and decided to level up. I have come through my long journey and I haven’t found any prime time yet. So, it’s the time to prepare to see my prime version. I am now practising four skills and advanced gramma for my entrance of IELTS exam. I sometimes visit free websites and learn new vocabularies, practise listening and read articles. All things considered, I’m just an intermediate level learner with strong passion and try in every way to promote myself for my coming opportunities and life welfare.
