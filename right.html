                 The Importance of Human Rights
             </br></h1>
              
             We already know that there are a lot of developed countries as well as developing countries in the world. No matter how they develop or not, the basic method used as a main vehicle for country is Democracy. But some countries do not use this method as it does not appropriate for them. In reality, “Democracy” is an administration method that emphasizes the people’s wishes and realizes these wishes as fast as possible. But the wishes have to be good things. From my point of view, I think that the countries that follow the democracy method are developing faster and faster. It is because this method is very convenient to perform citizens’ chance, in other word, the human rights. </br>
            The word “human right” is not as plain word. It has a lot of essence more than you think as the world we live in is composed these human rights. You can just think about the world that does not have any human right. If the people do not have human rights, they will not have both sympathy and empathy. So, we cannot find the justice in like that world. It will be full with pains, sad, injustice, murders, jealousy and many bad things. That phenomenon is very scary just in thinking. Therefore, the human right is a necessary thing for unions which want a perfect lifestyle. Today, a lot of leaders try to get balanced human right for a variety of people. However, some places are weak to give every people a balanced human right. For example, two disabled children who were born in different parts of the world. The first child was born in my native country, Myanmar. The second child was born in U.S.A. Even both are disabled children; their according improvements will not be the same as the human right given by each country may be difference. In my opinion, I think the American boy is more convenient in daily life more that Myanmar child. Although I do not want to talk the dark side of my country, I have to say it as these things are true. Actually, my country is quite weak in human right but the U.S.A is opposite of Myanmar. Therefore, the fact is showing that how human rights are important. It can be said that the basic foundation for the developing of many countries. You can think that the world that have a balanced human right. It will be very good in just thinking. Human activities do not has limit and the wants are not limit. The rich guys want to be richer and richer. It is nature. But if they got idea to donate his money or he did it, he is the human who share his human rights to others.</br>
            The facts that I submitted show that the importance of human rights. It is an essential thing from household to the big country. Finally, having a balanced human right makes us to be humane people.
