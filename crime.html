             <h1>Crime is a big problem in the world
            </br></h1>                             
               
               
             Since the downturn of modern civilisation, many bad things have come as a consequence of the massive development of mankind. Since people try to keep up with such events, they have already had an urge to do anything for their welfare, considering that no one else could control their lives.  Thus, as a result of huge evolutionary attempts, people have developed both sides of their minds—good and evil, as we can see that some people are super generous and kind, but some are extremely crude and rude. By the way, when people of crude and rude characters cannot face their yucky reality, they go for the easy one, and crimes have appeared.</br>
              As a matter of fact, we, humans, are composed of positive and negative emotions and are trying not to be more like asymmetry, loading more negative emotions than positive ones. Also, the current society breeds lots of stress and anxiety. Everything in life does not come in an easy way, and it becomes more and more difficult nowadays. Moreover, when it comes to living and career, we have found ourselves struggling hard with challenging situations 24/7 throughout the year. To cut a long story short, we can get stressed easily and can encounter destitution. Thus, people started committing crimes for various purposes—to release stress, to become prosperous, and for many other personal purposes in their daily lives. Many people believe that there is nothing that can be done to prevent crime. But, in today’s world, governments have affiliated with lots of associations to combat crime. And they release violent and strict laws in order to prevent people from committing crime. Many police forces are also found to control and solve crimes with well-trained police. For these activities, crime would not act like what it is likely to be in most people's daydreams. That is it mostly ended up with a solution for prevention. But, in this world of 7 billion people, it is mostly impossible to control every single person—both mentality and physical activity. Thus, crime continues as long as life goes on and society expands. Although it is quite reasonable to control one physically, their mentality due to chronic stress and anxiety is unstoppable and can lead to crime with a lack of conscience. Thus, we can say that crime will be completely stopped when we have overcome our negative emotions in a resilient and determined way. 
          </br>All things considered; crime prevention seems to be less used compared to endless sentences for those who have committed one. On the contrary, we can say that it will be of much benefit to prevent it rather than letting it happen and making judgments. Thus, we should do much speech delivery and encouragement to those who are running into mental difficulties and help as much as we can. The best thing is to bring justice to the entire world, not just in a few places of good atmosphere, and consequently, make the world a better place to live in. However, in reality, we have struggled over centuries to bring justice, but have failed. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to assume that nothing can be done to prevent crime with our current decencies and various attitudes..
