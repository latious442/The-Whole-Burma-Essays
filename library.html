                 The important of library
             </br></h1>

             The sense of  a community is created by the individuals knowledges and judgement depending on the performed experience. In there, the major one is that everyone thinks of about a person based on their creativity and thinking. So, these abilities are vital for every single mankind on the world to make a perfect stability of being a human being. Such unique abilities mainly come from a normal and usual building where the precious things are stored. The things inside this building are the only things that show how the building is glorious. It is maintained by generation by generation and it has a major role to play in everything that happen on the planet. The treasure in side it is even difficult to name. It is library, the existence beyond measure.</br>
             In any parts of the world, libraries can be found here and here. Actually, it has been a guide for humanâ€™s manners for at least a century. It makes people mature in a particular way in which people can get knowledge and sense by reading the books in the library. Moreover, the most important, the most expensive, the rarest, the most respectful and the meaningful facts are recorded in the books and these books are put in the library. For this reasons, libraries become the necessary ones for welfare and happiness of people. There is no leader in the world who does not even enter the library once. If you get famous, just go to library, find the way to fame and implement it. On the other hand, if you get notorious, just go to the library, imitate the ugliest behavior of the earlier people and make it in reality. The great innovations had to appear due to the action of  people who relied on the books in the library. We can find everything we want to find in the library from religion to latest facts. To cut the short, it is a great source of all the happenings and facts of the whole world. Every institution should have a library because it can create a productive one. Even on one cares about one feelings, he can release his feeling by giving his soul to the books at the corner of the library. Thus, we and the library will establish in the same thing as if we were blood brothers.
            </br>In conclusion, we have made our dream in reality. We really appreciate the nature for giving us a unique intelligence unlike any other creatures. But, we forget about one things that train up to be strong enough to encounter every problems we will meet-the library. From my point of view, the library have been playing a major role in human era until we get endangered form the world.
