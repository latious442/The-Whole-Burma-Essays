                 Why pollutants affect our environment
             </br></h1>


             The world we live is composed of different types of animals and plants and a balanced ecosystem. The creative facts are present within the environment. It can also be said that the environment maintains our life on the basis of our activities. The environment has such a considerable impact on humans world that humans take the advantages of the environment as much as they can in various ways. Thus it will lead to a severe deterioration of environment and we will suffer back. The classifications the things that cause environmental damage are as follows.</br>
             We commonly known as pollutants are the things that make our environment unclean. Pollutants are substances or particles that contaminate the environment and have harmful effects on living organisms. They can be found in various forms, including solid, liquid, and gas. Pollution can result from natural processes or human activities. There are different types of pollutants, such as: air pollutants, soil pollutants, water pollutants, noise pollutants and light pollutants. Among them, air pollutants are greatly affected on environment. These include gases like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. They can be emitted from vehicles, factories, power plants, and other sources. We may suffer the diseases related with respiratory system and lungs because of air pollution. The pollution of air can also lead to the global warming which is one of the worst environmental problems. The release of greenhouse gases by humans usages makes the extent of greenhouse affect increase in certain way. Thus the type of pollutant is a danger for the life-sustaining process of human beings. Water pollutants are substances that contaminate water bodies like rivers, lakes, and oceans. Examples include toxic chemicals, heavy metals, sewage, and fertilizers that enter the water through industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, or sewage systems. This type of pollutant can certainly lead to the severe environmental damage to us. The uncleanness of drinking water, the mosquito problem and disgusting smell are the common causes of water pollution. Soil pollutants include chemicals, pesticides, and heavy metals that contaminate the soil. Agricultural practices, improper waste disposal, and industrial activities contribute to soil pollution. This may be harmful the agricultural fields badly and also the monetary management of the country at a worrying rate. In spite of there being different types of environmental pollutants, they all have adverse effects on living organisms and ecosystem. Therefore, ensuring the long-term health and well-being of both humans and the environment requires a balance between our needs and the protection of the natural condition on ourselves.</br>
             To cut a long story short , humans and the environment are interconnected and have a complex relationship. Humans greatly depend on the environment for their survival and well-being. We rely on natural resources such as air, water, food, and raw materials to meet our needs and maintain our societies. Intimately, we ourselves should deal with the problems of our environment to resee our world get healthy.
