                 Why justice is important for people
             </br></h1>


             World, actually, is a complex place to understand. And, even it is difficult to say what is really happening in the world. These facts mentioned above became stronger soon after the society advances more than before. A saying goes that you snooze, you lose. The best way to survive today  completely depends on your skills. But, the things still cannot explain easily. For example, some people burst into tears while some burst out laughing. Some are below the poverty line, but some people have affluence at all. Those dwell in a premium organization with the endless care, love and scope. This type is also known as privileged class. However, some people get into hot water with various ways and are oppressed because of fortune. There may be a lot of reasons for being this. But, there is  a reason that no one can deny. Lack of justice!</br>
             I guess everyone has ever experience the moment that is unfair. And, people’s response is various in different ways. But, they only say one thing about that. “ It will be better to be a fair condition, justice”. Justice is the fair and equitable treatment of people. It is the cornerstone of our society and it is essential that everyone be treated fairly. Justice is also about making sure that everyone has an opportunity to be successful. But, some people think that the word “Justice” reveals for big organizations like government. But, in reality, there should be a justice between each human whether rich or poor. But, it sometimes exists as sympathy, empathy and humanity. You should notice that as everything has give and take, it is not suitable for you to get justice, but not give back. Justice is not the thing that can only activate by only rich or powerful men. Thus, you as a citizen should try to get the justice from the tiny matters to bigger ones. Sometimes, you may experience or feel something is one-sided. In this situation, you have to think in both sides. You would see the truth when you have two opinions about a case. It will be important in solving the problems. Justice is important for people because it is a fundamental principle of human rights. It is the cornerstone of our legal system and it is the foundation of our society. It is the principle that says everyone should be treated the same, regardless of their social, economic, or political status. What if the justice is gone from our society? The crime would increase in everywhere and every time. People would start confusing and disrespect each other. The improvement could be stopped with a rapid rate. To put it simply, we would be as same as animals. Thus, justice is essential for humankind to have humanity. As a youth, by helping his or her surrounding with the true kindness, one should try to get justice. 
            </br>For me, Justice is just a combination of humanity, sympathy, empathy and kindness. The value of justice is undefined so we should maintain it all the time. Especially, in this condition of our country, it is so meaningful for each. We all should try to be on the right form of the country with the power of justice. Whatever you have faced, in the end, justice will win.
