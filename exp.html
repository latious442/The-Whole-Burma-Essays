             Experience is the best teacher
             </br></h1>

             With the heated flames of people’s unlimited wants and needs, they start to find the best way to get perfect at all in very situation they have to encounter. No matter how fast we change as result of time, the appetite of want beyond our mean will never run out. Thus, we find ways to sort out this easily- to be convenient in every life events. In there, the best answer might be ‘Experience’ because we have already proved that it is one of the best ways for a person to glow up successfully and to be well-established with a condition. For many reasons, it can still beyond compare among another other ways to the path of our life welfare.</br>
             Experience is often considered the best teacher, as it provides us with invaluable lessons that cannot be learned through any other means. Through our experiences, we gain wisdom, develop new skills, and build character. Whether good or bad, every experience shapes who we are and helps us grow into better individuals. In this essay, I will explore why experience is indeed the best teacher and how it can shape our lives in countless ways. Experience teaches us valuable lessons that cannot be found in books or classrooms. While theoretical knowledge is important, it pales in comparison to the practical application of what we learn through experience. For instance, a student may study physics in school, but until they actually conduct experiments and observe the laws of motion firsthand, they will not truly understand the subject. Similarly, when we face challenges and obstacles in life, we must rely on our past experiences to guide us. If life were a miracle, it would be a wing to overcome it. The past experiences in our life can only teach what is right or wrong but also lead to a better experience. Most people dare to think. But, most of their daydream has not happened into a reality as they fail to carry out them to the management of their past experience. Bad experiences we have met guide us not to go wrong, as well, good experiences warm us to get better. It is such a teacher of our mind, controlling our conscious mood for our whole life. All things considered, experiences are such a perfect teacher that we ourselves are in the influence of them in everywhere and every time. 
            </br>To sum up, we have already known that the presents of the nature are the greatest of all time just as our unique intelligence. Similarly, experiences are also the best gift of nature to build a good world for ourselves. Experiences help us cultivate empathy and compassion by exposing us to different cultures, beliefs, and ways of living. Therefore, experience has been acting as a teacher of human to make us intelligent, matured and empathetic.
