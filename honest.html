             <h1>
              Honesty is the best policy
             </br></h1>
             Some people believe that it is best for people to be honest at all times. Others, however, believe that it is occasionally necessary to lie. Discuss both views and give your opinion. 
Our world is composed by various kinds of living thing including humans. People usually say that different people, different minds. It is true because our thinking and characters can’t be the same. So, that difference of mind is the reason of “How does the word OPPOSITE form”. If people thinking are the same, our world will be simple. As my point of view, the different minds become a lot of fields. And a lot of technologies that we mostly used today do not form if we have the same minds .By Phycology; people always want to do something new which is commonly different from basic form. And a view has another view that is whether almost support original view or not like that every Mathematics sum has a lot of method to get the right answer. </br>
Some people believe that it is the best for people to be honest at all times and some believe that it is quite true, however, it is occasionally necessary to lie. By seeing the first point of view, working with trust make us stronger than working with rules. Honesty is one of the types of mine that shows the human’s characteristic. Actually, honesty is the basic of the justice. It is important for everybody. So, ancient people say that to have the honest mind is more important than to have a beautiful body. The above sentence is acceptable. As we are Buddhist, honesty is not the strange with us. It is not easy not easy to try to be an honest people. It is the best for people to be honest. I will tell you one example to know how honesty is important. It is a test book of old G-11 namely “Yay Thay Pya Zat” This book indicate that how you are poor, if you have an honest mine, you can be rich. And unhonest can be danger. For the people who are ever honest, even they got a problem; there is a support that helps them because of their honest solving.</br>
Although, honesty is important, sometimes we have to relinquish because of a serious condition. Owing to the bad mind of people and injustice world, sometimes, we must use the lie if it is necessary. Actually, real life is more difficult than you think. You will know that the honesty is not appropriate foe everybody when you have met various types of people. We notice that although lie is not good, we sometimes have to use it in terrible problems. For example, if a bad guy asks you your friend information to kill him, you tell the truth information or not. As for me, I never tell the truth if l experience this condition. I will lie. This is the key but nothing is good if it is over the limit. Second sentence is also reasonable.
As my point of view, I think that we have to lie when it is occasionally necessary. Actually we cannot be rich within we have an honesty mind. Real life is not the same in the legend or story. It is very difficult not to talk a lie in a day. In some plays or movies, people are rich or success because of their honesty. But in real life, the phenomena like that are very rare. Some people think that if they have an honest heart, they will be successful in life. That is one of the keys to get a successful life but we cannot perfect within it. We need strength, trying hard, perseverance and so on. People don’t want to die. If they meet a deadly danger, they have no rule. Simple say, they can do everything, whether good or not when they meet a crisis. As an example, if you are on the road of success and somebody in your job want to stop you but you can’t do it, what is your respond, directly or just notice. And when your boss asked you whether you have any problem in the job, what will be your answer, yes or no? If you want to answer YES, it will be effect a human. He will loss his income. You will be the one who does not have sympathy. In this condition, what do you do? As for me, I will lie the answer like that “No” to save a human live hood.  So, this is the reason that I think that it is occasionally necessary to lie and I accept this concept.
