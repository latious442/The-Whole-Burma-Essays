             </br></h1>Last 10 years ago, the big improvement of human society had discovered. Everybody knows it “ Artificial Intelligence” (AI). The forming of it can help the human to be more convenient to do everything. But, for those who assume that AI is not perfect at all, they say that AI cannot give the study format with teacher. It is literally true. But , I advocate the evolution of AI because of its unique abilities.</br>
             AI is commonly used after 2010 and it gradually becomes an important assistant for most humankinds. The definite meaning of AI is that Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science and engineering that deals with the creation of intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. AI research is focused on creating systems that can understand natural language, carry out complex tasks, and make decisions. .So, from my point of view, AI has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. For example, AI could help us to automate tasks that we currently do manually, such as booking airline tickets or ordering foods. AI could also help us to make better decisions, by providing us with information that we would not be able to access on our own. It is so convenient for developers, designers, commercial trackers and various kinds of business. And, the open AI like chat GPT can act the designs as a commercial product, AI paintings, discussions about your job or education. There has been increasing the number of people who use AI for their personal businesses. For me, the open AI helps me in finding the information I want to know faster than other social media and the data are so effective and then they are so useful for me. Moreover, as I am a student, studying is not an unusual activity in my daily life. By using the artificial intelligence, I can update my learning forms and as well as my abilities. In other fields, AI could help us solve many complex problems. For example, AI can solve the puzzle faster than the humans do. So, AI is used vastly to calculate and predict the amount of ingredients we should use in a building and even the design of the latest building.
             We can lose the warmness, care, love, respect, opinion, sharing and experience of learning with human teacher when the use AI is absolutely spread all over the world. In other words, AI cannot give love and care as the human do. Another concern is that some people may order AI to create the deadly weapons and control the major webs. So, the evolution of AI can either be have a positive or negative, Therefore, I think the result will be different based on the use of each person. The problems mentioned above can be solved with the updated AI or new invention of  effectiveness of AI. We can also solve it by making more powerful security systems. Moreover, although it cannot give warmness and love like the human teachers, it can give useful and accurate information that make you improve.</br>
             To sum up, AI cannot be perfect at everything. But, it is extremely useful for every humankind and every business. It is more intelligent than human. And, it has no affectation like human. Therefore, it assumes that the evolution of AI is a good invention for human society.
